# User NFTs in Round - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The `userNFTsInRound` mapping has been successfully implemented in the FundRaisingContractNFT contract to provide comprehensive tracking of user investments per round.

## Data Structure

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256[])) public userNFTsInRound;
```

**Structure**: `roundId => user => tokenIds[]`
- Tracks which NFTs each user owns in each round
- Automatically populated when users invest
- Enables efficient querying and analytics

## Implemented Functions

### 1. Core Tracking Functions

#### `getUserNFTsInRound(uint256 roundId, address user)`
Returns array of NFT token IDs owned by user in specific round.

#### `getUserNFTCountInRound(uint256 roundId, address user)`
Returns number of NFTs user owns in specific round.

#### `hasUserInvestedInRound(uint256 roundId, address user)`
Returns boolean indicating if user has invested in the round.

### 2. Investment Analytics

#### `getUserTotalInvestmentInRound(uint256 roundId, address user)`
Returns:
- `totalUSDT`: Total USDT invested by user in round
- `totalTokens`: Total tokens received by user in round

#### `getUserRoundSummary(uint256 roundId, address user)`
Comprehensive summary returning:
- `nftCount`: Number of NFTs owned
- `totalUSDTInvested`: Total USDT invested
- `totalTokens`: Total tokens received
- `expectedReward`: Expected reward amount
- `totalExpectedPayout`: Principal + reward
- `hasMaturedInvestments`: Boolean if any investments matured
- `hasRedeemedInvestments`: Boolean if any investments redeemed

### 3. Round Analytics

#### `getRoundInvestors(uint256 roundId)`
Returns:
- `investors[]`: Array of unique investor addresses
- `nftCounts[]`: Corresponding NFT counts for each investor

## Automatic Population

The mapping is automatically populated in the `investInRound` function:

```solidity
// Track investments
roundTokenIds[roundId].push(tokenId);
userInvestments[msg.sender].push(tokenId);
userNFTsInRound[roundId][msg.sender].push(tokenId); // ← New line added
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Check if user invested in specific round
const hasInvested = await contract.hasUserInvestedInRound(roundId, userAddress);

// Get user's NFTs in round
const userNFTs = await contract.getUserNFTsInRound(roundId, userAddress);

// Get complete user summary
const summary = await contract.getUserRoundSummary(roundId, userAddress);
const [nftCount, totalInvested, totalTokens, expectedReward, totalPayout, hasMatured, hasRedeemed] = summary;
```

### Analytics Dashboard
```javascript
// Get all investors in a round
const [investors, nftCounts] = await contract.getRoundInvestors(roundId);

// Calculate round statistics
const totalInvestors = investors.length;
const totalNFTs = nftCounts.reduce((sum, count) => sum + count, 0);
const averageNFTsPerInvestor = totalNFTs / totalInvestors;
```

### Portfolio Management
```javascript
// Get user's position across all rounds they invested in
const allUserInvestments = await contract.getUserInvestments(userAddress);

// For each unique round, get detailed summary
const roundSummaries = [];
const uniqueRounds = [...new Set(allUserInvestments.map(async (tokenId) => {
    const investment = await dzNFT.getInvestmentData(tokenId);
    return investment.roundId;
}))];

for (const roundId of uniqueRounds) {
    const summary = await contract.getUserRoundSummary(roundId, userAddress);
    roundSummaries.push({ roundId, ...summary });
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Efficient Querying**
- Direct access to user's NFTs per round
- No need to iterate through all NFTs
- Gas-efficient read operations

### 2. **Enhanced Analytics**
- Complete investment tracking per round
- Investor demographics per round
- Performance metrics calculation

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- Quick portfolio overview
- Round-specific investment history
- Real-time investment status

### 4. **Administrative Tools**
- Round performance analysis
- Investor behavior insights
- Compliance and reporting

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
npm run test:user-round-tracking
```

This test demonstrates:
- Multiple users investing in multiple rounds
- Multiple investments per user per round
- All tracking functions working correctly
- Accurate calculations and summaries

## Gas Optimization

The implementation is gas-optimized:
- Uses storage efficiently
- Minimal additional gas cost per investment
- Read operations are view functions (no gas cost)
- Batch operations where possible

## Security Considerations

- All functions include proper access controls
- Round existence validation on all queries
- No external dependencies for tracking
- Immutable historical data once recorded

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Time-based investment tracking
- Investment performance metrics
- Automated reward calculations
- Cross-round portfolio analytics
