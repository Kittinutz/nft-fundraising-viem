- **Original Investment**: Wallet2 invests 2 tokens → receives 2 NFTs
- **Transfer Process**: Both NFTs transferred from Wallet2 → Wallet3
- **Ownership Update**: Wallet2 balance = 0, Wallet3 balance = 2
- **Token ID Verification**: Specific token IDs properly transferred

### **✅ Reward Claim Rights**

- **New Owner Claims**: Wallet3 successfully claims all rewards
- **Original Investor**: Wallet2 has no claim rights after transfer
- **Total Rewards**: 1060 USDT claimed by Wallet3 (30 + 1030)
- **Investment Details**: Properly tracked under new owner

### **✅ ERC721Enumerable Integration**

- **getWalletTokenIds()**: Returns correct token IDs for each wallet
- **Transfer Function**: Standard ERC721 transferFrom works
- **Balance Tracking**: Accurate before/after transfer balances
- **Ownership Queries**: ownerOf() returns correct current owner
